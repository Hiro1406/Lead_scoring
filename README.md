This project focused on helping marketing teams prioritize their efforts by identifying which potential leads were most likely to convert into customers.

What the project does: It uses machine learning to analyze user behavior—such as click records and product features—to predict the likelihood of a conversion. By assigning a "score" to each lead, the business can focus its resources on high-value prospects rather than treating all leads equally.

What I did:

Data Strategy: Leveraged an Amazon affiliate dataset to extract meaningful patterns from user behavior and product interactions.
Model Development: Developed and refined a predictive model using Logistic Regression.
Optimization: Significantly boosted the model’s performance from a 78% to an 85% F1-score through rigorous feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning using Grid-SearchCV.
Business Impact: Provided a tool that enables more accurate marketing decision-making, ensuring budget and time are spent where they have the highest ROI.
