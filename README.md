Project: Lead Scoring Prediction
I developed a machine learning model to predict customer conversion likelihood by analyzing affiliate click data. I boosted the F1-score from 78% to 85% through feature engineering and Grid-SearchCV tuning. By transforming user behavior into actionable lead scores, I provided a solution that helps marketing teams prioritize high-value prospects and optimize their decision-making process.

Overview
This project addresses a common business challenge: identifying high-value leads within a sea of potential customers. By analyzing user behavior and product interactions, this machine learning solution predicts the conversion likelihood of a lead, allowing marketing and sales teams to prioritize their resources effectively.
